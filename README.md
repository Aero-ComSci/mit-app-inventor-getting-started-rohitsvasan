4. Add a quick reflection(2 sentences) about what was difficult __Place on Readme__
The most difficult part of the code was the fact that this was an website that I never used before, and that I found the user interface to be significantly less intuitive than things like Scratch. All of that made it so that it was difficult to know what each piece of code meant and how to use it.
